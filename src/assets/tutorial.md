# Welcome to Paperling 👋

This is a **real, editable document**. Nothing here is a screenshot: everything
you see rendered on the right is produced from the markdown on the left. Poke at
it, change things, and watch the preview update live.

> Tip: press **Ctrl+E** to flip between Reader, Split and Code views. In Split
> view you can edit and preview side by side, which is the best way to explore
> this guide.

Open the outline (the list icon in the bottom bar, **Ctrl+Shift+O**) to see every
heading below turn into a clickable table of contents.

## 1. The formatting basics

You can write **bold**, *italic*, ***both***, ~~strikethrough~~ and `inline code`
without ever touching the mouse. A few handy shortcuts:

- **Ctrl+B**: bold the selection
- **Ctrl+I**: italic the selection
- **Ctrl+K**: turn the selection into a link

> Block quotes are great for asides, callouts and citations.

1. Ordered lists just work.
2. So do nested ones:
   - like this
   - and this

## 2. Task lists

Track what's done right inside your notes. Try clicking a checkbox in the
preview:

- [x] Install Paperling
- [x] Open this guide
- [ ] Write my first note
- [ ] Export it to PDF

## 3. Tables

| Feature        | Shortcut       | Notes                          |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Command palette| `Ctrl+P`       | Search every action and file   |
| File explorer  | `Ctrl+Shift+E` | Browse the current folder      |
| Outline        | `Ctrl+Shift+O` | Jump between headings          |
| Global search  | `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Find text across your folder   |

## 4. Code with syntax highlighting

Fenced code blocks are highlighted by language, and each one gets a
copy button in the preview.

```js
function greet(name) {
  // Paperling highlights this automatically
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome aboard.`;
}

console.log(greet("writer"));
```

## 5. Math and formulas

Paperling renders LaTeX math with KaTeX. Write inline math like $E = mc^2$ or
the quadratic formula between double dollar signs:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

It handles sums, integrals and matrices too:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}\,dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\qquad
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Chemistry works as well, via the `mhchem` extension:

$$
\ce{CO2 + C -> 2 CO}
$$

## 6. Diagrams with Mermaid

Turn a fenced `mermaid` block into a diagram. Here's a flowchart of how a note
travels through Paperling:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Type markdown] --> B{Split view}
    B --> C[Live preview]
    B --> D[Outline updates]
    C --> E[Export to PDF / HTML / Word]
```

And a quick breakdown of where writers spend their time:

```mermaid
pie showData
    title A writer's afternoon
    "Writing" : 55
    "Editing" : 30
    "Staring out the window" : 15
```

## 7. Footnotes and links

You can cite sources with footnotes[^1] and link out to anything, like the
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).

Internal links between your own notes use wiki-style syntax. Typing
`[[Another Note]]` links straight to a file in the same folder, and Paperling
autocompletes the names as you type `[[`.

[^1]: Footnotes render down here, and the reference above links to them.

## Where to next?

- Press **Ctrl+P** and start typing to reach any command instantly.
- Drop an image into the editor and Paperling saves it alongside your note.
- Pick a theme (Dark, Light, Paper, Dracula) from the gear menu.

That's the whole toolkit. Delete everything on this page and start writing your
own note whenever you're ready. Happy writing! 🚀
